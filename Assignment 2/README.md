Comments:          About my HelloPloy assignment. I followed the PDF file to implement the app. I set two colors as View background color and Polygon View background color respectively. Above the Polygon View, I used labels to show number of sides if users do “Increase” or “Decrease” operations on polygons’ sides. To implement the function of drawing a polygon on Polygon View, I created two files, PolygonView.h and PolygonView.m, to implement this. Moreover I used protocol “”PolygonViewDelegate” and delegate to optimize coding. In the end, I set the stroke color and fill color of the polygons. So they will appear on the Polygon View.

PS:The codes which PDF provides to us about drawing polygons’ points on View are not correct. I modified the codes to make it work.
